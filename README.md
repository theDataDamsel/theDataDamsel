# Hi, I am Aine Lenihan

I work at the intersection of **AI strategy, governance, and analytics** in highly regulated environments.

My focus areas:
- Enterprise AI adoption and AI Centers of Excellence
- GenAIOps and MLOps oversight, not just model building
- AI governance, risk and compliance in banking and other regulated sectors
- Turning vague "AI ideas" into governed, measurable business outcomes

What you will find here:
- Templates and examples for enterprise RAG and GenAI projects
- Playbooks for AI governance and CoE operating models
- Small, opinionated demos focused on *how organisations should actually run AI*, not just toy models.

If you work on AI in a regulated or risk-sensitive environment, follow me.
